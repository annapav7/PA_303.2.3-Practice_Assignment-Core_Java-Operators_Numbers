        // Tasks:
        /* 1. Write a program that declares an integer a variable x,
            assigns the value 2 to it, and prints out the binary string
            version of the number ( Integer.toBinaryString(x) ). Now, use
            the left shift operator (<<) to shift by 1 and assign
            the result to x. Before printing the results, write a comment
            with the predicted decimal value and binary string. Now, print
            out x in decimal form and in binary notation.
            Perform the preceding exercise with the following values:
                - a. 9
                - b. 17
                - c. 88
         */

        /* 2. Write a program that declares a variable x, and assigns 150 to it,
        and prints out the binary string version of the number. Now use the right s
        hift operator (>>) to shift by 2 and assign the result to x. Write a comment
        indicating what you anticipate the decimal and binary values to be.
        Now print the value of x and the binary string.
        Perform the preceding exercise with the following values:
             - a. 225
             - b. 1555
             - c. 32456
         */

        /* 3. Write a program that declares three int variables: x, y, and z.
            Assign 7 to x and 17 to y. Write a comment that indicates what you predict
            will be the result of the bitwise and operation on x and y. Now use the bitwise
            AND (&) operator to derive the decimal and binary values, and assign the result
            to z.
         */

        /* 4. Now, with the preceding values, use the bitwise and operator to calculate
            the “or” value between x and y. As before, write a comment that indicates
            what you predict the values to be before printing them out.
         */

        /* 5. Write a program that declares an integer variable, assigns a number,
            and uses a postfix increment operator to increase the value.
            Print the value before and after the increment operator.
         */

        /* 6. Write a program that declares an integer variable, assigns a number,
            and uses a postfix increment operator to increase the value. Print the value
            before and after the increment operator.
         */

        /* 7. Write a program that declares two integer variables: x, and y, and
            then assigns 5 to x and 8 to y. Create another variable sum and assign
            the value of ++x added to y, and print the result. Notice the value
            of the sum (should be 14). Now change the increment operator to postfix (x++)
            and re-run the program. Notice what the value of the sum is. The first
            configuration incremented x, and then calculated the sum, while the second
            configuration calculated the sum, and then incremented x.
